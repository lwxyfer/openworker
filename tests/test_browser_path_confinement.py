"""The browser connector's two filesystem tools must stay inside the session's roots.

The permission engine path-scopes only the built-in ``WRITE_TOOLS``, and only by reading
``arguments["path"]`` (``permissions.PermissionEngine.evaluate``). A connector tool that
touches local files is therefore invisible to it, in both directions:

  browser_upload_file   reads any readable path and hands it to the loaded page
  browser_screenshot    writes a PNG to any writable path, creating parent dirs

``email_tools`` already confines outgoing attachments to the granted roots; these tests pin
the same rule for the browser tools.
